# Home Assistant Community Add-on: TeddyCloud

An alternative Server for your Toniebox.

## About

TeddyCloud is an alternative server for your Toniebox, allowing you to host the cloud services locally. 
This gives you the control about which data is sent to the original manufacturer's cloud and allows you to host your own figurine audio files on e.g. your NAS or any other server.

You can find more information about this addon [here](https://github.com/mrueg/addon-teddycloud/blob/main/README.md).

If you run into any issues, please view the open issues [here](https://github.com/mrueg/addon-teddycloud/issues) and create one if it doesn't exist.
